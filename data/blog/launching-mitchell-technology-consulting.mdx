We constantly hear about companies and institutions struggling with data breaches and privacy concerns. But the same data we generate massive amounts of every day present immense potential for positive change. To improve how organizations protect this data and safely use it in data-intensive applications like artificial intelligence, I'm launching a freelancing business, [Mitchell Technology Consulting](https://mitchell-technology-consulting.com/).

I've spent over 15 years working at a wide range of organizations, from early-stage startups to large government institutions. I've utilized multiple technologies building and maintaining many types of data-focused products. I've succeeded both as an individual contributor and team lead, and I'm comfortable working with and presenting to any section of an organization.

I believe Mitchell Technology Consulting[^1] is the perfect way for me to work with a wide range of businesses to improve data utility and privacy in AI and other software applications. And I'm especially excited about the possibility of expanding the usage of privacy-enhancing technologies such as differential privacyÂ â€“ a method that allows us to analyze data without revealing sensitive individual information.

If you want to improve the way your team uses and protects your organization's data and the applications that use that data, [schedule a free consultation](https://mitchell-technology-consulting.com/forms/contact/) today!
